            Why I prefer dogs over cats:
        </h2>
        <p>Dogs for me are the best animals to exsit. Not only are they adorable but also very playful and full of energy. They change a boring and fruitless day to become most exciting once you play with them! They also can learn amazing cool tricks to gain bragging points, cool right? :)</p>
